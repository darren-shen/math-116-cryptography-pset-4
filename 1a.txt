the map was normally disguised as a blank piece of parchment. to view the map, one would tap it with one's wand and recite, 'i solemnly swear that i am up to no good.' the content of the map would then reveal itself. to hide the contents of the map so the parchment appeared blank again, one would again tap it and recite, 'mischief managed.'
